- **Impact:** App window title would show incorrect branding
- **Fix:** Updated to "Elythra Music"

- **Impact:** Audio notifications would show incorrect app name
- **Fix:** Updated both notification channel name and desktop media kit title

### 3. **Major Version Inconsistency**
- **Issue:** Android `build.gradle.kts` had severely outdated version:
  - versionCode: 5 (should be 25)
  - versionName: "0.5" (should be "1.12.0")
- **Impact:** Android app would report wrong version, breaking update mechanisms
- **Fix:** Synchronized to version 1.12.0 with build code 25

### 4. **README Documentation Issues**

- **Impact:** Potential conflicts with other apps, unprofessional implementation
- **Fix:** Updated to proper app-specific ID: "com.elythra.music.audio"

### 6. **GitHub API URL Case Sensitivity**
- **Issue:** `Updater.kt` used wrong case in GitHub API URL: "fncshaolin/Elythra"
- **Impact:** Update checks would fail due to 404 errors
- **Fix:** Corrected to "fncshaolin/elythra"

### 7. **Discord Integration Branding**
- **Issue:** `DiscordRPC.kt` had two problems:

  - GitHub URL case: "fncshaolin/Elythra" ‚Üí "fncshaolin/elythra"
- **Impact:** Discord rich presence would show incorrect branding and broken links
- **Fix:** Updated button text and corrected URL case

### 8. **Polish Localization Inconsistency**
- **Issue:** `values-pl/strings.xml` Discord information still used "Elythra" instead of "Elythra Music"
- **Impact:** Polish users would see inconsistent branding
- **Fix:** Updated all instances to "Elythra Music"

### 9. **Package Description Missing Branding**
- **Issue:** `pubspec.yaml` description didn't include "Elythra Music" branding
